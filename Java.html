                <p style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 400;">This project was completed during my second year of studies, where we were tasked with developing a calculator using the Java programming language. It served as a valuable learning experience in both coding and problem-solving. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Java's core concepts and its application in creating functional software. Our team collaborated closely to design and implement the calculator's features, and it provided an excellent opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to a practical project. In the end, the project not only enhanced our programming skills but also demonstrated our ability to develop a useful application using Java.</p>
